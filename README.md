# BeatBanger Autoplay

Simple BeatBanger auto-player with a WPF GUI for Windows 7+. <br>
(In principle just emulating keyboard presses timed to the underlying notes.cfg)

To run the standard version of the software you might need to install a specific .net runtime. If you don't have it already you'll get a prompt to download it from Microsoft when you launch the software. <br>
If you don't want to deal with the runtime directly there is also the self-contained (_SC) release you can choose.

With V2.0 everything is prettier and better and ✨Just Works✨,... i hope...

If the exe is in the game folder when started it'll figure everything out on its own, if it's not you'll get a folder select where you have to select the game folder manually.

The Reload button: hooks into the game, gets the memory addresses, loads all available levels and reloads the in-game hotkeys(if you changed them)

If everything is hooked and loaded you can just start any level in the game and watch it play itself it.

Have fun :D!
